# Hard-Clustering 

Kmeans is the prominent hard clustering method for image segmentation. It has been used for image segmentation because of its unsupervised characterstics. However, it has few problems like dead center and trapped center problems.


Optimized K?means (OKM) algorithm that can homogenously segment an image into regions of interest with the capability of avoiding the dead center and trapped center at local minima phenomena. EMKM-2 is variant of EMKM that enhanced the moving concept of the conventional Moving K-Means (i.e. certain members of the cluster with the highest fitness value are forced to become the members of the clusters with the smallest fitness value).



Interested readers can go through the published paper on it [1][2], where it was tested for grey outdoor images.
